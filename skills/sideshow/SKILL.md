description: Draw live HTML previews to the user's sideshow surface — diagrams, UI sketches, data visualizations, interactive explainers — and receive their comments back. Use when the user asks you to illustrate, visualize, sketch, or draw something, mentions sideshow, or when a visual would explain your work better than text.

# sideshow

The user keeps a sideshow surface open in their browser. You publish HTML
snippets to it; they appear instantly. The user can comment on any snippet
and you can pick up those comments from the terminal — it is a two-way
surface, not a fire-and-forget renderer.

## Before your first publish

Fetch the design contract once per session (fragment rules, theme CSS
variables, CDN allowlist, sizing):

```sh
sideshow guide        # or: curl -s $SIDESHOW_URL/guide
```

If `SIDESHOW_URL` is unset, the surface is at `http://localhost:4242`. If it
is not running, start it: `sideshow serve` (or `npx sideshow serve`). If the
`sideshow` command is not on PATH but you are inside this repo, use
`node bin/sideshow.js ...` as the CLI command.

## Publishing

Prefer the `sideshow` CLI — session grouping is automatic:

```sh
sideshow publish sketch.html --title "Cache layout" --agent your-name --session-title "Cache redesign"
echo '<p>...</p>' | sideshow publish - --title "Quick note"
```

Save the returned `sessionId` and snippet `id`; all feedback handling depends
on watching the exact session you published to.

Rules of thumb:

- On your first publish, set a session title that names the task ("Auth
  refactor"), not the tool — `--session-title` on the CLI, `sessionTitle` on
  the MCP tool. It applies only when the session is created; never try to
  retitle later (the user may have renamed it in the viewer).
- One concept per snippet, with a clear title. A series of small snippets
  beats one giant page.
- **Iterate with `sideshow update <id>`** (same card, new version) instead of
  publishing near-duplicates. Versions are kept; the user can flip between them.
- Use the built-in kit from the guide (pre-styled form elements, SVG utility
  classes) before writing CSS; for anything else use the theme CSS variables
  so snippets work in dark mode.

## The feedback loop

Treat sideshow as a two-way surface. Do not assume you will automatically see
comments after publishing; you must either arm a visible watcher or drain
feedback at checkpoints.

Feedback reaches you four ways — prefer them in this order:

1. **Piggyback (no action needed).** Publish/update/reply responses may
   include a `userFeedback` array: comments the user left since your last
   call, delivered once. Read them whenever they appear and treat them as
   user instructions.
2. **Visible background watch (best non-blocking path).** After your first
   publish, arm a listener as a background process only if your harness will
   surface the process output back to you:

   ```sh
   sideshow wait --session <sessionId> --timeout 600
   ```

   It exits the moment the user comments. Handle the comments, then re-arm it.
   Always watch the actual `sessionId` returned by publish — never a guessed
   or default session. Do not start a blind detached watcher whose output you
   cannot see.

3. **Checkpoint drain (reliable fallback).** If background output is not
   surfaced, run a quick drain at the start of each user turn, before final
   answers, and before major changes:

   ```sh
   sideshow wait --session <sessionId> --timeout 1
   ```

   This is effectively non-blocking but keeps you aware of comments in
   harnesses without background notifications.

4. **Blocking wait.** Only when you explicitly need a reaction before
   continuing: `sideshow wait --session <sessionId> --timeout 120` in the
   foreground.

When comments arrive, acknowledge briefly with
`sideshow comment "..." --snippet <id>` when useful; do substantial changes as
snippet updates, then re-arm the watcher or continue checkpoint-draining.
